\paragraph*{Remark: On the Optimality of the Symmetric Three-Point Distribution.}
In the adopted near-field model, each antenna element experiences an identical
amplitude $|\beta|$, and the received signal differs only in phase
$\phi(x;\eta)=\tfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}\!\left(xu-\tfrac{1-u^2}{2r}x^2\right)$.
Hence, all localization information resides in the \emph{phase derivatives}
$\partial_u\phi\!\propto\!x+\tfrac{u}{r}x^2$ and 
$\partial_r\phi\!\propto\!x^2$, corresponding to the ``slope'' and
``curvature'' terms. Shifting the array toward the target does not
increase SNR but introduces a nonzero cross-covariance
$\mathrm{cov}(x,x^2)$, which reduces the determinant
$\Delta=\mathrm{var}(x)\mathrm{var}(x^2)-\mathrm{cov}^2(x,x^2)$ of the
Fisher information matrix and enlarges both $\mathrm{CRB}_u$ and
$\mathrm{CRB}_r$. A symmetric geometry ensures
$\mathrm{cov}(x,x^2)=0$, fully decoupling angle and range estimation and
yielding
\[
\mathrm{Tr(CRB)}=\kappa\!\left[
\frac{\alpha(u,r)}{\mathrm{var}(x)}+
\frac{\beta(u,r)}{\mathrm{var}(x^2)}\right],
\]
where $\alpha(u,r),\beta(u,r)\!>\!0$ are constants independent of the
geometry. Maximizing $\mathrm{var}(x)$ and $\mathrm{var}(x^2)$ under
the aperture constraint leads, by the moment-extremal theorem, to a
three-point symmetric distribution supported on $\{-a,0,+a\}$.
Even for edge cases (e.g., $u\!\to\!1^-$), this configuration remains
optimal, as further right-shifting only reintroduces coupling without
improving Fisher information.
