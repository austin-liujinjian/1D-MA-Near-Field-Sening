\section{System Model}

Consider a single-target sensing scenario empowered by a movable-antenna (MA) array.
The target is located in the near-field region of the array but outside its reactive region,
which means that the propagation distances between the target and all antenna elements
fall within the Fresnel region.
Here, $\lambda$ denotes the signal wavelength and $a$ represents the array half-aperture.

\subsection{Geometric Parameterization}

We adopt a near-field spherical-wave model.
Let the target location be parameterized as
\[
\bm{\eta} = [u,\,r]^{\top}, \qquad u = \cos\theta,
\]
where $\theta$ denotes the angle of arrival (AoA),
and $r$ is the distance between the array reference point (phase center) and the target.

The position of the $m$-th antenna element is denoted by $x_m$
along the array axis. Then, the exact propagation distance between the
target and the $m$-th element is given by
\begin{equation}
r_m(\bm{\eta}) = \big\|\,\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{s}_m\,\big\|
= \sqrt{\,r^2 - 2rux_m + x_m^2\,}.
\label{eq:exact_distance}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Steering Vector and Path-Loss}

The array manifold (steering) vector under the spherical-wave model is expressed as
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x}, \bm{\eta})
=
\big[
e^{j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_1(\bm{\eta})},\,
e^{j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_2(\bm{\eta})},\,
\ldots,\,
e^{j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_N(\bm{\eta})}
\big]^{\top}.
\label{eq:steering}
\end{equation}

For each antenna element, the path-loss coefficient is determined
by the inverse-square law as
\begin{equation}
\beta_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\,r_m^2(\bm{\eta})}},
\label{eq:pathloss}
\end{equation}
which explicitly depends on the true geometric distance $r_m(\bm{\eta})$
and thus varies slightly across the array in the near-field.

If the array aperture is sufficiently small compared with the range (i.e., $a/r \ll 1$),
the amplitude variation can be neglected and \eqref{eq:pathloss}
reduces to the uniform-spherical-wave (USW) model:
\[
\beta_m \approx \beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi r^2}},
\]
which assumes identical path-loss for all elements.

\subsection{Channel Representation}

The complex channel coefficient between the $m$-th antenna element and the target is then given by
\begin{equation}
h(x_m,\bm{\eta})
= \beta_m\,e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}r_m(\bm{\eta})}.
\label{eq:hxm}
\end{equation}

Accordingly, the complete line-of-sight (LoS) channel vector is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{h}(\mathbf{x}, \bm{\eta})
&= 
[\,h(x_1,\bm{\eta}),\,h(x_2,\bm{\eta}),\,\ldots,\,h(x_N,\bm{\eta})\,]^{\mathrm{T}} \\
&= 
\big[
\beta_1 e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}r_1(\bm{\eta})},\,
\beta_2 e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}r_2(\bm{\eta})},\,
\ldots,\,
\beta_N e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}r_N(\bm{\eta})}
\big]^{\mathrm{T}}.
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:hvector}
\end{equation}

When the uniform path-loss assumption holds, \eqref{eq:hvector} simplifies to
\[
\boldsymbol{h}(\mathbf{x}, \bm{\eta})
= \beta\,\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x}, \bm{\eta}) \in \mathbb{C}^{N}.
\]

\subsection{Optional Fresnel Approximation}

For analytical tractability, one may invoke the Fresnel (second-order) approximation:
\begin{equation}
r_m(\bm{\eta}) \approx r - x_m u + \frac{(1-u^2)x_m^2}{2r},
\label{eq:fresnel}
\end{equation}
which allows closed-form CRB derivation but introduces noticeable bias
when $a/r$ is not sufficiently small (i.e., in the strong near-field regime).
