\section{System Model}

Consider a single-target near-field sensing scenario empowered by a
movable antenna (MA) array.
Let the target location be parameterized by
\[
\eta=[u,r]^{\top},\quad
u=\cos\theta,
\]
where $\theta$ denotes the angle-of-arrival (AoA) and $r$ is the distance
between the array reference point and the target.
The wavenumber is defined as $k=\tfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$
is the carrier wavelength.

\paragraph*{Baseband Channel Model.}
The baseband channel vector observed by the MA array is modeled as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x},\eta)
=\beta\,\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},\eta),
\label{eq:chmodel}
\end{equation}
where $\beta\!\in\!\mathbb{C}$ denotes the
complex-valued channel (path) coefficient that incorporates the common
reflection, scattering, and path-loss effects, and is identical for all
antenna elements.
The array manifold vector is given by
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},\eta)
=\big[e^{j k r_1(\eta)},\,e^{j k r_2(\eta)},\,\ldots,\,e^{j k r_M(\eta)}\big]^{\top},
\label{eq:steering}
\end{equation}
where $r_m(\eta)$ is the propagation distance between the target and the
$m$-th antenna element located at $x_m$, expressed as
\begin{equation}
r_m(\eta)
=\sqrt{r^2-2r u x_m+x_m^2}.
\label{eq:rm}
\end{equation}
Since the array aperture is much smaller than the target distance
($A_T\!\ll\!r$), the amplitude variations among different elements caused
by $1/r_m$ are negligible, and the corresponding attenuation is absorbed
into the common coefficient $\beta$.
Therefore, all antenna elements experience an identical amplitude
$|\beta|$, and only their phases differ.

\paragraph*{Fresnel Approximation.}
By applying the second-order (Fresnel) approximation to
\eqref{eq:rm}, one obtains
\begin{equation}
r_m(\eta)\approx r - x_m u + \frac{1-u^2}{2r}x_m^2.
\label{eq:fresnel}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{eq:fresnel} into \eqref{eq:steering}, the steering
vector becomes
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},\eta)
=\exp\!\left\{j k
  \left(x_m u - \tfrac{1-u^2}{2r}x_m^2\right)\right\}_{m=1}^M,
\label{eq:steering2}
\end{equation}
which clearly reveals that the spatial information of the target is
encoded in the \emph{linear} and \emph{quadratic} phase terms, associated
with the angular ``slope'' and range ``curvature'' of the wavefront,
respectively.
