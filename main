\paragraph*{Remark: Why the Symmetric Three-Point Distribution Remains Optimal Even for Edge Targets.}
In the adopted near-field model, each antenna element experiences an identical
amplitude gain $|\beta|$, and thus the received signal differs among elements
only through the spatially varying phase 
$\phi(x;\eta)=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\!\left(xu-\frac{1-u^2}{2r}x^2\right)$.
Consequently, the Fisher information relies solely on the
\emph{phase sensitivity} to the parameters $\eta=[u,r]^\top$,
that is, on the derivatives
\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u}\propto x+\frac{u}{r}x^2
\quad\text{(``slope'')},\qquad
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r}\propto x^2
\quad\text{(``curvature'')}.
\]
Since all array elements have equal amplitude, moving the entire array
toward the target (e.g., to the right-hand side) does not enhance the
per-element signal-to-noise ratio; instead, it introduces a nonzero
cross-covariance $\mathrm{cov}(x,x^2)$ between the ``slope'' and ``curvature''
features. This coupling reduces the determinant
$\Delta=\mathrm{var}(x)\mathrm{var}(x^2)-\mathrm{cov}^2(x,x^2)$
of the Fisher information matrix while also increasing the numerator terms
of $\mathrm{CRB}_r$, thereby degrading both angular and range estimation
accuracy. In contrast, a symmetric geometry enforces
$\mathrm{cov}(x,x^2)=0$, perfectly decoupling the two types of information.
Under this condition, the trace of the CramÃ©r--Rao bound simplifies to
\[
\mathrm{Tr(CRB)}=\kappa\!\left[
  \frac{\alpha(u,r)}{\mathrm{var}(x)}
  +\frac{\beta(u,r)}{\mathrm{var}(x^2)}
\right],
\]
where $\alpha(u,r),\beta(u,r)>0$ are merely scaling factors dependent on
$(u,r)$ but do not alter the optimal geometry. Maximizing
$\mathrm{var}(x)$ and $\mathrm{var}(x^2)$ under the aperture constraint
leads, by the moment-extremal theorem, to a three-atomic symmetric measure
supported on $\{-a,0,+a\}$ with adaptive weights
$p^\star(u,r)=1+t-\sqrt{t(1+t)}$ and 
$t=\beta(u,r)/(\alpha(u,r)a^2)$.
Even when the target lies at the rightmost direction ($u\!\to\!1^-$),
this distribution remains optimal: its right endpoint already attains the
boundary of the aperture, and shifting the array further right would only
reintroduce feature coupling without any gain in Fisher information.
Hence, the symmetric three-point structure constitutes a globally optimal
and robust configuration for all possible $(u,r)$ pairs under the
equal-amplitude near-field model.
