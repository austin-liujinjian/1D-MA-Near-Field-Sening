	\section{System Model}
	

	
	Consider a single-target sensing scenario
	empowered by a movable-antenna (MA) array, target is located in the near-field region of the linear array
	but outside its reactive region, which means that the distance
	between the target and any position within the MA array is
	within Fresnel distance, where $\lambda$ is the signal wavelength and $a$ is the half aperture. 
	
	We adopt near-field model, 
	
	Let the target location be parameterized by
	\[
	\bm{\eta}=[u,r]^{\top},\quad
	u=\cos\theta,
	\]
	where $\theta$ denotes the angle-of-arrival (AoA) and $r$ is the distance
	between the array reference point and the target.
	
	
	The array manifold vector is given by
	\begin{equation}
		\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},\bm{\eta})
		=\big[e^{j \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_1(\bm{\eta})},\,e^{j \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_2(\bm{\eta})},\,\ldots,\,e^{j \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} r_M(\bm{\eta})}\big]^{\top},
		\label{eq:steering}
	\end{equation}
	where $r_m(\bm{\eta})$ is the propagation distance between the target and the
	$m$-th antenna element located at $x_m$, the spherical path difference can be accurately calculated as:
	\footnote{This can be approximated
		up to the second-order (Fresnel) term in the Taylor expansion $r_m(\bm{\eta}) \approx r - x_m u + \frac{1-u^2}{2r}x_m^2$.}
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			r_m(\bm{\eta})
			&=\sqrt{r^2-2r u x_m+x_m^2}
			\label{eq:fresnel}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	Substituting \eqref{eq:fresnel} into \eqref{eq:steering}, the steering
	vector becomes
	\begin{equation}
		\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x},\bm{\eta})
		=\exp\!\left\{j \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
		\left(\sqrt{r^2-2r u x_m+x_m^2}\right)\right\}_{m=1}^M,
		\label{eq:steering2}
	\end{equation}
	
	Let path loss $\beta$ between
	the origin of the MA array and the target is
	\footnote{
		For USW model, typically $\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi r^2}}$, where $r$ represent the distance between the array reference point and the target, i.e., the propagation distance of LoS path, which is \textit{independent} of MA geometry with given aperture.
	}
	\begin{equation}
		\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi r_m(\bm{\eta})}}
	\end{equation}
    Then, the channel
	coefficient between the $n$-th MA and the target is given by
	\begin{equation}
		h(x_n,\bm{\eta})
		= \tilde{\beta}\,e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}r_n(x_n,\bm{\eta})}
		= \beta\,e^{j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\!\left(x_n u - \frac{x_n^2(1-u^2)}{2r}\right)},
		\label{eq:hxn}
	\end{equation}
	is the complex channel gain that incorporates the common
	reflection, scattering, and path-loss effects, and is identical for all
	antenna elements.
	
	As a result, the echoed LoS channel
	vector can be written as
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{x},\bm{\eta})
			&= [\,h(x_1,\bm{\eta}),\,h(x_2,\bm{\eta}),\,\ldots,\,h(x_N,\bm{\eta})\,]^{\mathrm{T}} \nonumber \\
			&= \beta\,\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x},\bm{\eta}) \in \mathbb{C}^{N},
		\end{aligned}
		\label{eq:hxvector}
	\end{equation}
